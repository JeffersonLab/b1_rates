 --------------------

 Most likely you start off with the following three files:

 - README .......... this file.
 - qcdnum1612.uu ... uu encoded (can be sent via email) gzipped tarfile
                     containing all relevant QCDNUM1612 files.
 - mbunpak1612 ..... simple unix script to uu decode, gunzip and
                     extract all files from the tarfile.

 Copy these to an empty directory, goto this directory and type:

                     mbunpak1612

 After this you should have the following files:

 qcdnum1612.car .... Qcdnum source code.
 qcdnum1612.ps ..... Qcdnum writeup.

 workshop.car ...... Simple toymodel evolutions.
 mrsa.car .......... Evolution and F2p a la MRSA.
 fpdflib.car ....... Structure functions from PDFLIB input.

 xxxx.log .......... logfiles of the example jobs above.

 makefile .......... makefile to create a library.
 runpatchy ......... simple script used by makefile.

 The makefile serves as an example: please make the necessary
 modifications to get it going on your machine.
 It is of course important that I get informed (h24@nikhef.nl) about 
 compiler messages (even warnings) as they may point to a bug.


 12-08-98 QCDNUM16.12
 --------------------
 Bug fixes: 1. LREADB, LREADC, LPLUS were not declared logical.
            2. Few other very minor fixups.
            3. Two (!) bug fixes in mrsa.car affecting the bottom distn.

 17-01-98 QCDNUM16.11
 --------------------

 1. Bug fix in the NLO calculation of xF3. At low x~10^-5 xF3 from 
    QCDNUM16.10 was wrong by about 10-15%, much less so at high x.
    The QCDNUM16.11 manual is identical to that of version 16.10.

 03-12-97 QCDNUM16.10
 --------------------

 1. Improved logic to detect if a parton distribution has already
    been evolved (important for speeding up QCD fits). In QCDNUM16.00
    this logic was flawed and, for instance, caused the b+ non-singlet
    distribution to be *not* evolved in the example job mrsa.car.

 2. Protection against evolving down to or below the QCD scale parameter
    Lambda**2. No such protection was built into QCDNUM16.00 causing
    the program to be caught into very time consuming (machine
    dependent) recovery procedures if alphas was calculated at or
    below Lambda**2.

 3. New: alfas = QALFAS ( Q2, Lambda_out, nf_out, ierr ) which also returns
    the current value of the QCD scale parameter Lambda(nf).

 4. You can set the top mass for the alpha_s evolution by a call to
    QNRSET ( 'MTALF', value ). In QCDNUM16.00 this mass was fixed
    internally to 188 GeV.

 5. For details see the updated manual qcdnum1610.ps.


 25-08-97 Differences between QCDNUM16.00 and QCDNUM15
 -----------------------------------------------------

 1. QCDNUM16.00 is backwards compatible with QCDNUM15. User code should 
    therefore run without any modification. You have to recreate the
    weight files though - see (2) below.

 2. More compact storage of weight tables.
    The weight tables in QCDNUM16.00 are more efficiently stored. In
    particular the heavy quark weight tables are reduced by a factor of 
    nx/2 ~ 50 when 100 x-gridpoints are used. This implies:

    - Smaller executable (factor 5 typically).
    - Heavy quark weight tables take only a few minutes to calculate.
    - Weight file size is reduced by more than a factor of 10.
    - F2b and FLb are now also available.
    - QCDNUM15 weight files cannot be read by QCDNUM16.00.

    w15to16.f is a small job to convert QCDNUM15 to QCDNUM16.00 files.

 3. In QCDNUM16.00 the charm/bottom mass can be set differently for the
    heavy quark structure function calculations and for the evolution of
    alpha_s:

   +-------+---+-------+--------------+------------------------------------+
   | var   |typ| deflt |     value    | description                        |
   +-------+---+-------+--------------+------------------------------------+
   | MCSTF | R |  1.5  |  0.15000E+01 | C mass for F2c, FLc (GeV)          |
   | MBSTF | R |  5.0  |  0.50000E+01 | B mass for F2b, FLb (GeV)          |
   | MCALF | R |  1.5  |  0.15000E+01 | C mass for alpha_s evolution (GeV) |
   | MBALF | R |  5.0  |  0.50000E+01 | B mass for alpha_s evolution (GeV) |
   +-------+---+-------+--------------+------------------------------------+

    You can still use the QCDNUM15 variables 'CMASS' and 'BMASS' which
    will set the relevant mass equal for both the heavy quark structure
    functions and alpha_s (as was done in QCDNUM15). Resetting the heavy
    quark masses requires a re-calculation of the corresponding weight 
    table(s).

 4. In QCDNUM16.00 the renormalisation scale and the factorisation scale
    can be set. See the relevant sections in the write-up.

 5. The QCDNUM16.00 heavy quark structure functions are not calculated on
    the evolution grid but on a equidistant logarithmic x-grid (that is why
    the weight tables could be much reduced in size). Hence the results
    for the heavy quarks (at high x) are slightly different from those 
    obtained by QCDNUM15. The logarithmic heavy quark grid is maintained
    automatically by QCDNUM and is, in fact, invisible for the user.

 6. List of small differences:
    - Output variable IFL in QPDFIJ, QPDFXQ, QSTFIJ, QSTFXQ has a
      different meaning. See writeup.
    - Functions LFROMA and AFROML are not supported anymore.
    - In QCDNUM16.00 the heavy quark weight tables are calculated for all
      Q2 gridpoints. In QCDNUM15 you could pass a list of Q2 gridpoints as
      an argument to QNWILW. This argument is still there but has no 
      meaning in QCDNUM16.00.
